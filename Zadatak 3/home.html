            <p>For decades anime was only the domain of die-hard genre fans or people willing to hunt down rare, imported, VHS tapes to get their animation fix. Today, thanks to expanded licensing that brought more series to American shores, anime is bigger than ever. Maybe you caught Princess Mononoke when it made an end-of-year list or saw a stray episode of Dragon Ball Z on TV. But what is anime, and how did it get so popular?</p>
            <p>Whether you’re a longtime fan or a neophyte looking to get your feet wet, every anime fan probably has a few questions about its history. Here's a guide to the magical animated world of giant robots, giggling magic users, and post-apocalyptic chaos. By the time you’re fully acquainted with anime, Senpai will notice you for sure.</p>
            <h2>What is anime?</h2>
            <p>In its most basic form, anime refers to animation. Interestingly enough, the name itself isn’t an abbreviation of the English word animation. Instead, it’s how you say “animated cartoon” (written アニメ) in Japanese. To a Japanese viewer, anime is any cartoon, whether it’s made in Japan or not. Outside of Japan, however, the term anime has come to mean “animation made in Japan,” or more broadly, any animated show or movie that uses signature aspects of Japanese-style animation, like vibrant colors, dramatic panning, and characteristic facial expressions.  </p>
            <p>In the U.S., most anime is classified as a niche form of entertainment, especially for adults. It's looped in alongside other fandoms and often left to the wayside of mainstream entertainment. In Japan, however, anime is a culturally accepted and fairly basic form of entertainment for adults. This difference means that anime contains multitudes, with content produced for a wide range of viewers. Your first mental image of anime might be a spiky-haired magician or a sci-fi robot, but the genre contains multitudes. From drama, action, and romance to historical fiction, horror, comedy, and more—there’s an series to match any taste.</p>
