                <h2>Attack on Titan: Where Each of the Anime’s Fife Titans Are (& Who Wields Them)</h2>
                <p>As the Attack on Titan anime has finally revealed all Five Shifter Titans, let's go over who possesses each of them, and where they are right now. The final season of Hajime Isayama's Attack On Titan is currently airing and after almost a decade of content, the anime is drawing to its epic conclusion. At this point, all of the Shifter Titans, known as the Five Titans, have been revealed and almost all of their powers uncovered (at the time of writing). Here's a quick rundown of all of the five Shifter Titans, what their powers are, who they currently belong to and their current whereabouts.</p>
                <h3>The Founding Titan</h3>
                <p>The first of all the Titans, the Founding Titan is the ultimate Titan; the point at which all of the "paths" created by the other Titans and Subjects of Ymir merge. Sometimes called the "Coordinate," the Founding Titan can create and control other Titans via its scream. This scream can also change the memories and even the physical composition of other beings -- a power that was used to wipe the memories of the Eldian who arrived on Paradis Island. Originally held by Ymir Fritz, the Founding Titan was more recently passed from Grisha Yeager to his son, Eren. Currently, as of Season 4 Episode 4, the Founding Titan is in Marley with Eren, waiting to be activated.</p>
                <h3>The Attack Titan</h3>
                <p>The most infamous Titan of all is the Attack Titan. Also the namesake of the anime and manga, the Attack Titan fights solely on the basis of freedom. With its quick reflexes and mighty strength, its physical composition makes it a tough combatant. Similar to the other five Titans, the Attack Titan can see the memories of both its past and future inheritors, though memories from the latter are often hazy and unclear. It's this ability to see these future memories that motivate the Attack Titan to fight on so that those bad premonitions don't need to happen. The Attack Titan is currently held by Eren Yeager and is with him in Marley as of the latest episode.</p>
                <h3>The Colossal Titan</h3>
                <p>One of the first Titans to be showed in Attack on Titan was the Colossal Titan. Absolutely massive in size, the Colossal Titan controls steam that is emitted by its body. This makes it very difficult to get close to it, providing a good defensive advantage in battle. Additionally, when the holder transforms into this Titan, it can control the blast emitted, potentially using it as an offensive tactic. The biggest feature of this Titan is obviously its sheer size -- it can ven tower over the massive walls of Paradis Island. The current holder of this Titan is Armin Arlert, who inherited it from Bertholdt Hoover. Armin's exact whereabouts have yet to be revealed after the time skip, though it's likely still on Paradis Island.</p>
                <h3>The Female Titan</h3>
                <p>The Female Titan is easily the most versatile Titan of the five. It can easily mimic the attributes of the other Titans, including hardening parts of its skin (like the Armored Titan) and using its scream to draw Pure Titans (like the Founding Titan) to it. It's very fast, nimble and good on the offensive. Annie Leonhart is the current holder of the Female Titan after being chosen to inherit it in Marley. Following her capture by the Survey Corps, Annie used her hardening ability to shroud herself in a crystal-like substance in order to avoid interrogation, rendering her useless. As of right now, the Female Titan is still underground on Paradis Island under the thumb of her captors, encased in her shell.</p>
                <h3>The Armored Titan</h3>
                <p>The Armored Titan is covered head-to-toe in armored plates of skin, protecting itself from physical damage. This makes it a very difficult opponent in battle as the armor is nigh-indestructible. What it has in self-protection it lacks in speed and other Titans, like the Attack Titan, can easily overrun it. The Armored Titan is also able to harden certain parts of its body with a crystal-like substance. It is currently in possession of Reiner Braun, who is in Marley as of the beginning of Season 4.</p>
